# DansNCISite
A reference implementation workflow for getting tokens.  IHCS should implement their own workflows, for example, study ids 
probably should not consecutive numbers.  Also you will select a set of participants from your subscriber base and generate
tokens.  I generate tokens in advance and allow people to use the tokens to test the system.  If you clone this, please change
the "NCI-" on line 19 of invite.js to an abbreviation from your facility (e.g. if you work at Greater Rockville Medical Center
replace the "NCI-" with "GRMC-".  You may want to change the html to reflect your facility too.

Have fun...
